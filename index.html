   <h1>IRAQ</h1>
   <p>The Iraq War  was a protracted armed conflict in Iraq
   from 2003 to 2011 that began with the invasion of Iraq by
   the United States–led coalition which overthrew the Iraqi
   government of Saddam Hussein. The conflict continued for
   much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to
   oppose the coalition forces and the post-invasion Iraqi
   government. US troops were officially withdrawn in
   2011. The United States became re-involved in 2014 at the
   head of a new coalition , and the insurgency and many
   dimensions of the armed conflict continue today. The
   invasion occurred as part of the George W. Bush
   administration 's War on Terror following the September 11
   attacks , <b>despite there being no connection between the
   attacks and Iraq.</b></p>
   <p>In October 2002, Congress granted President Bush the
   power to decide whether to launch any military attack in
   Iraq.[61] The Iraq War began on 20 March 2003, [62] when
   the US, joined by the UK, Australia, and Poland, launched a
   " shock and awe" bombing campaign. Iraqi forces were
   quickly overwhelmed as coalition forces swept through the
   country. The invasion led to the collapse of the Ba'athist
   government; Saddam Hussein was captured during
   Operation Red Dawn in December of that same year and
   executed three years later . The power vacuum following
   Saddam's demise and mismanagement by the Coalition
   Provisional Authority led to widespread civil war between
   Shias and Sunnis, as well as a lengthy insurgency against
   coalition forces . Many of the violent insurgent groups were
   supported by Iran or al-Qaeda in Iraq, with Iran giving
   support for predominantly Shia militias battling Al-Qaeda
   and other Sunni groups.[63] The United States responded
   with a build-up of 170,000 troops in 2007. [64] This build-up
   gave greater control to Iraq's government and military, and
   was judged a success by many. [65] In 2008, President Bush
   agreed to a withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq.
   The withdrawal was completed under President Barack
   Obama in December 2011. [66][67]
   The United States based its rationale for the invasion on
   claims that Iraq had a weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
   program[68] and posed a threat to the United States and its
   allies. [69][70] Additionally, some US officials falsely
   accused Saddam of harbouring and supporting al-
   Qaeda .[71] In 2004, the 9/11 Commission concluded there
   was no evidence of any relationship between Saddam's
   regime and al-Qaeda. [72] No stockpiles of WMDs or active
   WMD program were ever found in Iraq.[73] Bush
   administration officials made numerous claims about a
   purported Saddam–al-Qaeda relationship and WMDs that
   were based on sketchy evidence rejected by intelligence
   officials. [73][74] The rationale for war faced heavy criticism
   both domestically and internationally.[75] Kofi Annan , then
   the Secretary-General of the United Nations , called the
   invasion illegal under international law, as it violated the UN
   Charter. [76] The 2016 Chilcot Report, a British inquiry into
   the United Kingdom's decision to go to war, concluded that
   not every peaceful alternative had been examined, that the
   UK and US had undermined the United Nations Security
   Council in the process of declaring war, that the process of
   identification for a legal basis of war was "far from
   satisfactory", and that, taken together, the war was
   unnecessary. [77][78][79] When interrogated by the FBI ,
   Saddam Hussein confirmed that Iraq did not have weapons
   of mass destruction prior to the US invasion. [80]
   In the aftermath of the invasion, Iraq held multi-party
   elections in 2005. Nouri al-Maliki became Prime Minister in
   2006 and remained in office until 2014. The al-Maliki
   government enacted policies that alienated the country's
   previously dominant Sunni minority and worsened sectarian
   tensions. In the summer of 2014, ISIL launched a military
   offensive in northern Iraq and declared a worldwide Islamic
   caliphate , leading to Operation Inherent Resolve , another
   military response from the United States and its allies.
   According to a 2019 US Army study, Iran has emerged as
   "the only victor" of the war. [13]
   An estimated 151,000 to 1,033,000 Iraqis died in the first
   three to five years of conflict. In total, the war caused at
   least one hundred thousand civilian deaths, as well as tens
   of thousands of military deaths (see estimates below ). The
   majority of deaths occurred as a result of the insurgency
   and civil conflicts between 2004 and 2007. Subsequently,
   the War in Iraq of 2013 to 2017, which is considered a
   domino effect of the invasion and occupation, caused at
   least 155,000 deaths, in addition to the displacement of
   more than 3.3 million people within the country.</p><br><br>
   
   <h2>LIBYA</h2>
   <p>There has been speculations in recent years as
   to the real reason behind the removal of Libya’s Muammar
   Gaddafi with one of the most popular theories being that he
   was in the process of establishing a single gold-backed
   currency for Africa called the Gold Dinar. Many conspiracy
   theorists are of the opinion that Gaddafi’s new plan for
   Africa would have meant an entirely new banking system for
   the continent which would have taken economic power away
   from the current western powerhouses and would have dealt
   a severe blow to the US Dollar-based monetary system.</p>
